# Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

**Problem Statement**

Supply chain operations involve coordination across multiple vendors, countries, and shipment modes. With this complexity, organizations often struggle to track performance, identify delays, and control costs effectively. Lack of real-time visibility into logistics metrics leads to inefficiencies, missed deadlines, and reduced profitability.
A critical question this dashboard aims to address is:

*"How can business teams quickly identify where issues exist in the supply chain and make data-driven decisions to improve performance?"*

**Project Objective**

The goal of this project was to build a Power BI dashboard that brings clarity to supply chain operations. I focused on answering key questions:

*Are orders being delivered on time?*

*Which vendors are causing the most delays?*

*How much are we spending on freight and insurance?*

*What shipment modes are the most cost-effective?*

*What does our margin look like after supply chain costs?*

**Outcome and Business Value**

The dashboard helped uncover where delays were happening, which vendors were underperforming, and how freight and insurance costs were impacting operations. It gave teams a clearer view of the supply chain and supported better, faster decision-making. By making key metrics easy to understand, it enabled stakeholders to find opportunities for cost savings and process improvement.
