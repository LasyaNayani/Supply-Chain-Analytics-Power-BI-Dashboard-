# Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

🔍 Problem Statement
Supply chain operations involve coordination across multiple vendors, countries, and shipment modes. With this complexity, organizations often struggle to track performance, identify delays, and control costs effectively. Lack of real-time visibility into logistics metrics leads to inefficiencies, missed deadlines, and reduced profitability.
A critical question this dashboard aims to address is:
*"How can business teams quickly identify where issues exist in the supply chain and make data-driven decisions to improve performance?"*

🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project was to build a Power BI dashboard that brings clarity to supply chain operations. I focused on answering key questions:

*Are orders being delivered on time?*

*Which vendors are causing the most delays?*

*How much are we spending on freight and insurance?*

*What shipment modes are the most cost-effective?*

*What does our margin look like after supply chain costs?*
